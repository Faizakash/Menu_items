#Data collection process:

To collect menu data, we identified the research question of addressing language barriers faced by ethnic minorities in Hong Kong when dining at Chinese restaurants. We visited several restaurants with full Chinese menus and collected the names and prices of common menu items, as well as collecting some data from online sources such as Openrice. The collected data was organized in a logical format for analysis.





#Our scope and rationale:

For businesses that serve a variety of communities in Hong Kong, having a bilingual menu with items in Chinese, English, and Urdu is crucial. A bilingual menu is primarily used to make sure that clients can easily access and comprehend the menu items for Pakistani and Indian people. A multilingual menu improves the eating experience for patrons who might not be native speakers of the language used to write the menu, which can lead to an increase in patron satisfaction and loyalty.

In the example of a Chinese restaurant, having a multilingual menu that includes English and Urdu can help draw patrons from a wider spectrum of backgrounds like Indian and Pakistani who can read Urdu and roman Urdu as well. As many residents of South Asian nations, including Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, speak Urdu, providing menu items in their mother tongue may help them feel more at home and valued. Similar to Chinese, English is the language that is spoken the most in the globe, therefore having a menu item written in English can assist draw clients who may not be proficient in Chinese.

Additionally, having a multilingual menu can assist restaurants in overcoming language difficulties and guarantee that consumers can place accurate orders. Additionally, it might assist in avoiding misconceptions and miscommunications that might arise as a result of a language barrier. In conclusion, offering a bilingual menu in Chinese, English, and Urdu can assist businesses to draw in a wider clientele, boosting client satisfaction, and enhancing everyone's eating experience.


#licensing and ethical issues

We need to make sure that the translations are exact and acceptable for the items on menu. Words or phrases may have distinct implications or meanings in other languages, making translations complicated and nuanced. To ensure accuracy and cultural sensitivity, it is important to have a professional translator or multilingual expert check the translations as there were a number of words which are pronounced similar to English and some food having same ingredient have two different names.It may be crucial to think about the moral ramifications of presenting menu items in various languages if you own a business in a multicultural area. As an illustration, although some could see it as a warm gesture that shows inclusion and appreciation for diversity, others might see it as a sign of cultural appropriation or tokenism.

#Potential uses in future:
